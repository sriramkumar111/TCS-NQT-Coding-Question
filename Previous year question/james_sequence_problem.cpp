/*James has a sequence of N numbers. There is also an integer X which is a random 
number from other sources. 
He is allowed to perform a specific operation on this sequence X number of times. 
Below is the operation: 
• Pick exactly one element from the sequence and multiply it with -1. 
performing the above operation. 
If the answer is large, print the result modulo. 
10e9 +7. 
Your task is to find out the number of different sequences which can be formed by 
Let us try to understand it with an example, 
N = 3 
X = 2 
S = [1, 2, 3] 
There are 2 ways in which this operation can be performed. 
• Way 1: Either -1 should be multiplied to the same element 2 times, OR 
• Way 2: -1. Should be multiplied to two different elements once each. 

Way 1: 
If we multiply -1, to each element 2 times. It will become +1 (-1 *-1). 
We will get same sequence for each element: 
• Multiply -1, 2 times to S[1] : [1, 2, 3]. 
• Multiply -1, 2 times to S[2] : [1, 2, 3]. 
• Multiply -1, 2 times to S[3] : [1, 2, 3]. 
So, the unique sequence is just 1 which is [1, 2, 3]. 
Way 2: 
If we multiply -1, to two different elements just 1 time each. We get: 
• Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[2] : [-1, -2, 3]. 
• Multiply -1 to S[2] & S[3] : [1, -2, -3]. 
• Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[3] : [-1, 2, -3]. 
Hence, we get a total of 3 different sequences from Way 2. 
Total 1 + 3 = 4 different sequences. 
Hence the answer is 4.000 
Example 1: 
• Input: 
3 1 -> Input integer, N, X 
{1, 2, 1} -> Input integer, S 
• Output: 
3 -> Output 
• Explanation: 
In the given scenario, we have X =1. Hence, we can have this multiplication of -1 only 
once. So, if we multiply -1, to different elements just 1 time. We get:    
o Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[2] : [-1, -2, 1]. 
o Multiply -1 to S[2] & S[3] : [1, -2, -1]. 
o Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[3] : [-1, 2, -1]. 
Hence, we get a total of 3 different sequences. 
So, the answer is 3. 
Example 2: 
• Input: 
3 2 -> Input integer, N, X 
{1, 2, 3} -> Input integer, S

• Output: 
4 -> Output 
• Explanation: 
There are 2 ways in which this operation can be performed 
o Way 1: Either – 1 should be multiplied to the same element 2 times, OR 
o Way 2: -1 should be multiplied by different elements once. 
As shown in the above Demo example, there will be a total of 4 different sequences 
which can be achieved from this. 
Hence the answer is 4.  */
